/**
 * Client for reading and processing {@link InboundSseEvent incoming Server-Sent Events}.
 * <p>
 * SSE event source instances of this class are thread safe. To build a new instance, you can use the
 * {@link #target(javax.ws.rs.client.WebTarget) SseEventSource.target(endpoint)} factory method to get
 * a new event source builder that can be further customised and eventually used to create a new SSE
 * event source.
 * <p>
 * Once a {@link SseEventSource} is created, it can be used to {@link #open open a connection}
 * to the associated {@link WebTarget web target}. After establishing the connection, the event source starts
 * processing any incoming inbound events. Whenever a new event is received, an
 * {@link Consumer#accept(Object) Consumer<InboundSseEvent>#accept(InboundSseEvent)} method is invoked on any registered event consumers.
 * <h3>Reconnect support</h3>
 * <p>
 * The {@code SseEventSource} supports automated recuperation from a connection loss, including
 * negotiation of delivery of any missed events based on the last received  SSE event {@code id} field value, provided
 * this field is set by the server and the negotiation facility is supported by the server. In case of a connection loss,
 * the last received SSE event {@code id} field value is send in the
 * <tt>{@value javax.ws.rs.core.HttpHeaders#LAST_EVENT_ID_HEADER}</tt> HTTP
 * request header as part of a new connection request sent to the SSE endpoint. Upon a receipt of such reconnect request, the SSE
 * endpoint that supports this negotiation facility is expected to replay all missed events. Note however, that this is a
 * best-effort mechanism which does not provide any guaranty that all events would be delivered without a loss. You should
 * therefore not rely on receiving every single event and design your client application code accordingly.
 * <p>
 * By default, when a connection the the SSE endpoint is lost, the event source will wait 500&nbsp;ms
 * before attempting to reconnect to the SSE endpoint. The SSE endpoint can however control the client-side retry delay
 * by including a special {@code retry} field value in the any send event. JAX-RS {@code SseEventSource} tracks any
 * received SSE event {@code retry} field values set by the endpoint and adjusts the reconnect delay accordingly,
 * using the last received {@code retry} field value as the reconnect delay.
 * <p>
 * In addition to handling the standard connection loss failures, JAX-RS {@code SseEventSource} automatically deals with any
 * {@code HTTP 503 Service Unavailable} responses from an SSE endpoint, that contain a
 * <tt>{@value javax.ws.rs.core.HttpHeaders#RETRY_AFTER}</tt> HTTP header with a valid value. The
 * <tt>HTTP 503 + {@value javax.ws.rs.core.HttpHeaders#RETRY_AFTER}</tt> technique is often used by HTTP endpoints
 * as a means of connection and traffic throttling.
 * In case a <tt>HTTP 503 + {@value javax.ws.rs.core.HttpHeaders#RETRY_AFTER}</tt> response is received in return to a connection
 * request, JAX-RS SSE event source will automatically schedule a new reconnect attempt and use the received
 * <tt>{@value javax.ws.rs.core.HttpHeaders#RETRY_AFTER}</tt> HTTP header value as a one-time override of the reconnect delay.
